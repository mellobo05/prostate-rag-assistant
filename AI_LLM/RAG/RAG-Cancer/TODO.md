# TODO List for Embedding Fallback Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated requirements.txt to include sentence-transformers for HuggingFace embeddings
- [x] Modified src/embeddings.py to implement fallback logic: Try Gemini API first, then HuggingFace local embeddings
- [x] Added logging to indicate which embeddings are being used

## Next Steps
- [ ] Install updated dependencies: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Test the embedding functionality to ensure fallback works correctly
- [ ] Verify that the application runs without errors when Gemini API is unavailable
